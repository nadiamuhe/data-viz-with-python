# Data Visualization with Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot (plotnine) and plotly

*by Nadia Muhe*

The following guide illustrates Python code to generate a series of basic common graphs using different Python libraries. It shows how to create histograms, bar charts, boxplots and scatterplots using the pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot (aka plotnine) and plotly libraries. This guide is especially useful to compare the code need to generate the same type of graph. 

See the Jupyter Notebooks file to view the complete guide.
